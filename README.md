# Leveraging-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-for-Vision-based-Human-Activity
This project explores how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning can be applied to recognize human activities from visual data. Using pre-trained models like VGG-16, the system classifies actions from video frames or image sequences with high accuracy, even when working with limited labeled data.
